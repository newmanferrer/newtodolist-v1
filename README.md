# _NEWTODOLIST V-1_

In this application I try to use some of the tools, technologies and good practices that I have learned in recent times. In this case I use React's Contex API for state management, I hope in other versions I will use other technologies such as Redux.

## _Project description_

We will be able, as you can imagine, in this application to manage the options of a typical crud, that is, create, read, update and delete our tasks.

For data persistence I use the local storage API. I have also tried to take better care of the style of the components and the interface that the user can observe as well as their interaction.

For now it also allows you to search for tasks by name or title and set priorities for each task to be done as well as the completion date.

I'm trying to implement clean architecture based on React and FrontEnd.

I hope in the next days to add some other interesting features that allow me to practice some technologies learned.
